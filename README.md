XIAO Arduino scripts

The purpose of this repo is to gather Arduino IDE example scripts that may have been modified to do a bit more. The license may vary by file because the code was copied from various places. They may not run on their own because libraries may need to be installed. This is really more of my scratchpad rather than something for people to be able to build on. I might make something reusable later.

## Useful Tips

If the hardware test is loaded, [this tip](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/beginners/why-does-my-esp32c3-xiao-not-uploading-code/) may be required to load something new afterwards.
1. Press the B (boot) button and keep it held
2. Press the R (reset) button
3. Release the reset button
4. Release the boot button.
